# Research Description
I work in the People & Robots Laboratory, which is a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) lab. My research focuses on accessibility and educational aids for adults with Down syndrome. The first iteration of the research is to design and develop a tablet application that combines augmented reality, object detection, and multimodal feedback to assist the user in learning a new task. In this project I developed the first iteration of an object detection system that will determine if the user is construcing a Lego set in the correct order, using the correct Lego piece.

The main contribution of my research is the development of multimodal technology for adults with Down syndrome that centers on personal and occupational growth by decreasing the time it takes to learn essential skills through a readily available system. However, this work could be
more generalizable. For example, an object detection system that can assist an individual in working through a task step by step can be used in many other outlets, such as on-the-job training, educational classroom aids, and even home improvement projects with enough data and testing. It can also be used as an extra safety layer to increase quality assurance.
